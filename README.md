# Monster Hunter Rise Tex Chopper  

A Python library and application for converting from MH Rise textures to DDS and back.

## Credit
**Wylele** - The swizzling algorithm was taken and reimplemented based on his code in the MHRice repository. https://github.com/wwylele/mhrice  
**K0lb3** - For the astc_decomp library which I modified to have ASTC decompression (the code is bundled with the modified version of his library to remove the PIL dependency).  
**Silvris** - For the code for unpacking the streaming versions of textures taken from his MHR-Texture-Scripts Repository (https://github.com/Silvris/MHR-Texture-Scripts). And the many very productive discussions on the format and the swizzling procedure.  
**Ando** - For his mapping of the MHRise texture format codes.
